## Comments to the results

Note that the file `inpainting_comparison_02.mat` only contains the SNR values (i.e. it does not contain the ODG scores),
as computed using the codes in this repository (and on a different machine than the results presented in the manuscript).
The only significant difference is in the computation times of the AM algorithm,
since this was slightly accelerated after submitting the manuscript.
