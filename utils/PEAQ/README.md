# PEAQ
This repo contains a Matlab version of the Perceptual Evaluation of Audio Quality algorithm.

The idea was to isolate the algorithm and update the code so it can run in newer versions of Matlab. 

The algorithm is implemented by P. Kabel in 2004 and the Matlab code is fetched from [jorgehatcrrma](https://github.com/jorgehatccrma)'s [repo](https://github.com/jorgehatccrma/AudioMorphing).
